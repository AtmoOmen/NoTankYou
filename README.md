# No Tank You
Plugin for XivLauncher/Dalamud, shows a warning banner ingame if none of the tanks in your party have their tank stance on.

Why would this be useful you ask?

Ever charged headfirst into a dungeon following you tank as a DPS, and all of a sudden realize a lot of aggro is changing?
And then realize moments later that you are building up a lot of aggro?
Then moments later... you are laying on the ground dead, thinking "oh, tank forgot their stance".

Well fret no more!

This plugin does have some overlap with tools that warn you if YOUR tank stance is off, however those tools don't warn you if OTHER's are off.

### Why is this useful?
* Avoiding confrontation and death
* Helping a friend when they forget their tank stance
* Realizing that a sprout keeps accidentally toggling stance repeatedly
* Personal reminder to put your own stance on
